--- Lousy hotel internet => Asked nicely twice... nothing more to do :)

---	Reading about how the fetch and push are working in eclipse (haven't used git for a while)

--- Had a bit of trouble adding Xuggler jars: "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no xuggle in java.library.path
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1709)" => Resolved it using Maven, new version of the API from this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30002911/how-to-solve-this-error-in-my-xuggler-java-project
	"Also it may be Xuggler related issue. Try to upgrade Xuggler to version 5.4 (from 5.2)."
	
--- Got a fatal exception while trying to access a file: 
				A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
			#
			#  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x000000006ee76520, pid=13968, tid=7220
			
			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26379501/access-violation-in-xuggler-cannot-write-minidump
			"The error code 0xC0000005 is an access violation, which is the native / JNI term for a NullReferenceException."
			
		=> After some reading and testing, I tried with a smaller(1.7MB) file downloaded from the net.
		 This seems to have solved the issue. 
		 TODO:Not sure why I am violating access on my file though...
